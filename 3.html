<h3>Blackberry의 진화</h3>

<h4> BlackBerry was born on 19 January 1999, with the release of the BlackBerry 850. In the immediate years that followed, the brand blew up, offering something all its competitors couldn't touch: Emails on the go.</h4>

<p style="margin-top:45px">Even if you didn't own a BlackBerry yourself, you can bet your bottom dollar that you knew someone who did, or that you would at least see one in the hands of someone else on a regular basis. That physical QWERTY keyboard with its tap, tap, tapping could be heard in every train carriage and on every plane. It wasn't just about emailing on the go though. You also had BBM - BlackBerry's Instant Messenger service.
It might be all about WhatsApp now, but BBM had read receipts down donkey's years ago. It was yet another unique reason to buy a BlackBerry, appealing to a range of people, not just those in suits. Sadly, those days are gone, and while BlackBerry may still have users, it's lost its mojo.</p>
