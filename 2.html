<h4> Samsung continues to be one of the most popular phone manufacturers in the world and with good reason. The company's Galaxy S flagship smartphones often pack the greatest tech, innovative designs and easy-to-use functionality that users love. </h4>

<p style="margin-top:45px">First released in June 2010, the Samsung Galaxy S ran on Android 2.1 and had an 800 x 480 Super AMOLED display. It also had a single-core 1GHz processor and 0.5GB of RAM. The rear camera was 5-megapixels, while the front was just 0.3-megapixels. The thing that really stood out about it was the customisation of Android. Although we'd seen some of TouchWiz on other devices, it felt like it worked on the Galaxy S.</p>

<p>Also known as the Samsung Galaxy S II, the refreshed phone was released in April 2011 and sported a similar 800 x 480 screen as its predecessor. The processor got a bump up to dual-core and 1.2GHz, and there was 0.75GB of RAM.The rear camera was 8-megapixels this time, with a 2-megapixel front-facing cam. Samsung embraced widgets with the Galaxy S II, something that rivals HTC was really pushing.</p>
